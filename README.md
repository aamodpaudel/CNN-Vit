# Pet Sentiment Classifier (CNN-ViT Hybrid Model):  A deep learning project to classify pet emotions (angry, happy, relaxed, sad) using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with PyTorch and Streamlit.


## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
- **Objective**: Balance and classify pet emotion images using data augmentation and a ViT-CNN hybrid model.
- **Dataset**: 7,400 raw images across 4 classes (angry, happy, sad, relaxed).
- **Augmentation**: Balances classes to ~2,000 images each using flips, rotations, and crops.
- **Model**: Fine-tuned pretrained ViT-b-16 model for classification.
- **UI**: Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

- **Before Augmentation**: The subfolders had the following files size - angry had 988,
happy had 4355
relaxed had 1203
sad had 844.
